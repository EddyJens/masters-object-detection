Metrics to calculate:
-Precision x Recall curve - done
-generate FROC curve for all algorithms - done
-generate FROC curve for all algorithm runs in the same window values - done
-Recall x IoU - could not find code neither references on how to generate curve
-implement NMS and classificator commitee - done
-generate visual plots of tp, fp, fn
